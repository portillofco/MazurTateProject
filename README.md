# MazurTateProject
Computer experimentation on Mazur and Tate Conjecture.

We include on this repository computational experimentation regarding the Mazur and Tate Conjecture.
So far, we have four files. All of them, are culminated!!

All the curves considered so far have rank 1 !

ProjectMazurTate7_24022015_end.sws   (Contains the evidence that the conjecture is satisfied for the first 1000 curves on Cremona Data Base)

ProjectMazurTate7_page2_300315_end.sws (Contains the evidence that the conjecture is satisfied for the 1001 to 2000 curves on Cremona Data Base)   

BigShaTate4_220315_end.sws (Contains the evidence for the first curves on cremona data base with order of the group of Tate-Shafarevich 4)

BigShaTate9_230315.sws  (Contains the evidence for the first curves on cremona data base with order of the group of Tate-Shafarevich 9)

Files can be run on SAGE.
